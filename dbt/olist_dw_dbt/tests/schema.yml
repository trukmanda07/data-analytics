      Critical data quality test that validates all orders have an associated customer_id.
      This ensures referential integrity between orders and customers tables.

      Test fails if any orders are found with NULL customer_id values, which would indicate:
      - Data loading issues
      - Missing customer records
      - Referential integrity violations

      Severity: ERROR (build will fail if test fails)
